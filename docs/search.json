I did this so that for my next table I could condense all of the genres into six different categories, allowing me to plot a graph showing the amount of movies/television shows in each genre.\nMy first graph represents that amount of movies/television shows in each genre. From this graph, we can see the most common genres are comedy and drama. The least common genres are crime and reality.\nFrom my second graph we can see the relationship between year, and movie/television show release date. We can infer from this graph that that a lot more movies and television shows were put on Netflix after the mid 2000s.\nI wanted to play around with the str_length function. So I took the length of all of the descriptions of each title. The mean of the description lengths was 143.1004 string characters.\nLastly, I created a new data frame that takes the title of the show and detects the R, PG-13, PG and G ratings\nReference:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows\nCredits to Shivam Bansal for this Dataset."
