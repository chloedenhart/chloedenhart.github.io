In this project, I analyze the distribution of drink categories using the TidyTuesday *All Drinks* dataset. The dataset provides detailed information about various drink types and their associated categories, which makes it ideal for exploring trends and understanding the popularity of different beverages.

```{r}
drinks <- read.csv("all_drinks.csv")


library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(drinks, aes(x = strCategory)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(
    x = "Drink Category",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Analysis of amount of drinks in each drink category",
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Here I created a bar plot that visualizes the number of drinks in each category. The x-axis represents the drink categories, while the y-axis displays their respective counts. To enhance readability, I rotated the category labels on the x-axis.

This visualization helps identify which drink categories are most common in the dataset and highlights trends that could inform further research or practical applications in food and beverage studies.
