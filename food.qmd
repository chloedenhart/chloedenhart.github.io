In this project, I analyze data from the TidyTuesday initiative, focusing on food consumption and its associated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The dataset provides insights into the relationship between different types of food consumption and their environmental impact. By visualizing this relationship, I aim to identify patterns and highlight how dietary choices contribute to CO2 emissions, a critical factor in discussions on climate change and sustainability.

```{r}
food <- read.csv("food_consumption.csv")

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(food, aes(x = co2_emmission, y = consumption)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "CO2 Emissions",
    y = "Consumption",
    title = "Relationship food consumption and CO2 emissions",
  )
```

Using the dataset `food_consumption.csv`, I created a scatter plot that depicts the relationship between food consumption levels (measured in kilograms per capita) and CO2 emissions (measured in kilograms of CO2 equivalent). This plot serves to illustrate whether foods with higher consumption rates also tend to have higher associated CO2 emissions.
